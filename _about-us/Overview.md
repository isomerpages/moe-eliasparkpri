#### Our History

<img src="/images/overview.png" style="width:243px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align="left"> Elias Park Primary School is located at 11 Pasir Ris Street 52 and is the third primary school constructed in the suburban town of Pasir Ris. The school was part of the Public Works Department 4th Primary School Building Programme, built to meet the demand for primary education by children living in Pasir Ris areas.

  

The school was officially declared opened by Mr Charles Chong, Honourable Member of Parliament for Pasir Ris GRC, on 12 July 1997. The school commenced to function on 3 January 1995 with a student population of 770 in 24 classes.

  

The school though relatively young, has established herself to be one of the good schools in the neighbourhood. This is reflected by the good response from the public during the yearly Primary One registration exercise.

#### Our School Crest

The School Crest is a composition of blue on yellow. The strong blue represents civility, seriousness and respect whilst the bright yellow, warmth and cheerfulness. The superimposition of these contrasting colours indicates the desire for a balanced approach to education.

  

Our School Crest possesses the characteristic of duality in design. The leaf, which signifies the sanctity of life, transforms into an image of a heart complete with twin chambers. The vessels of each chamber work to form the letters 'E' and 'P'.

'E' and 'P' are synonymous with the ideals of 'Endeavour' and 'Persevere'. These words, which rest on an open book, articulate that the pursuit of knowledge should ultimately lead to the cultivation of the soul. Success, symbolized by the laurel, is measured by these values held within the heart.  

The bold outer ring stands for unity and cohesiveness among staff and students - our vision of the school as one big family.

#### Our School Song

The lyrics to EPPS' School Song was written by our former Principal, Miss Chiang Wai Leng herself, resulting in a song which conveys our vision and mission well. The music for our School Song was composed by Mr Tan Soon Yong and the final score was the result of the work of Mr Mike Chia.

<center> United are we, in this happy place <br>
Earnest and disciplined, at work and at play; <br>
Cheerfully caring, cheerfully sharing <br>
Helping one another along the way.<br><br>

  

Filling our minds with knowledge<br>
Growing in wisdom day by day;<br>
Undaunted are we, in all that we do<br>
Though it may be uphill, all the way.<br><br>

  

Elias Park, Elias Park<br>
With you as my guide;<br>
We hope to face the future<br>
And to serve our nation with pride.<br><br>
