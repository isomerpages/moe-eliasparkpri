### Principal's Message

#### Welcome to the website of Elias Park Primary School (EPPS)!
 

Dear Parents / Guardians,

The school has made a remarkable journey under the able leadership of Miss Chiang Wai Leng, Miss Brenda Yeow, Mrs Wong Siew San and Mdm Cassie Fan.  It is not the numerous awards and accolades received but the outstanding quality of education, the citizens that our teachers have groomed and the close staff-parent bonding. I would especially like to thank all staff, past and present, for their contributions, dedication and hard work as well as the parents, our community partners and vendors for their trust and support in the school.

Many parents, from near and afar, have chosen to enrol their children at Elias Park Primary School (EPPS) because they believe in the quality of education that the school provides and the timeless universal values that we inculcate in our pupils.

As the pace of technological and social changes in the world accelerates, identifying and preparing our pupils for these exciting future opportunities would have to be a collaborative effort from our teachers, the community partners and the home.  Moving forward, Elias Park Primary School (EPPS) would be focusing on creating authentic learning experiences so that our pupils are better prepared to navigate the future world of opportunities, love Singapore and care for their families and our community.  Towards this end, we will build on our strengths and continue to immerse our students in a culture that is values driven, nurture their strengths and unleash their lively curiosity to explore, to create and to make lifelong learning their being.

These can be covered in three broad areas:

a) Inculcate values to build strong lives

A good set of values is like a moral compass that will guide our students’ behaviour. As pupils interact with the world, experiment with what they believe in, what works and how to decide right from wrong, they would learn deep lessons about how practice informs theory and how to live strong lives.  Teachers will role model learning and innovation, enthusiastic to support our pupils in exploring new ideas and always consider our values in decision making and behaviours.  In turn, our pupils will then be able to internalise these values and the roles that these values play to influence their lives.

b) Strengthen our curriculum that will prepare pupils for global connectivity and opportunities of the future

The curriculum and pedagogy of the school will be based on helping pupils explore, navigate and build trusts with people across races, nationalities, ages and social economic backgrounds. The learning process will involve pupils understanding the diverse cultures around us, sense make from the information presented and make good judgement before taking a decision.  Our curriculum and pedagogy will inspire pupils to ask questions, not be afraid of trying and making mistakes and persevere.

c) Develop positive personalities

Every pupil discovers who he is and what are his strengths based on his reflections, his learning and interaction with others.  EPPS will support all pupils in this journey of self-discovery.  Our teachers will help pupils to express themselves with humility and gratitude so that they can develop their personalities and articulate themselves positively, genuinely and confidently in the community. 

The task to bridge the gap between the promise of our ideals to help every child grow his/her strengths and the realities of our time is going to be tough, bumpy and the road ahead is a long and winding one.  I face this challenge with humility and acknowledge my own limitations.  At the same time, we cannot solve the challenges of our time unless we solve them together.  I am glad to be facing these challenges with the faith and capacity of my colleagues, the parents and friends and network of EPPS.  Together, we will work hard, join our hands, minds and hearts with a deep belief in our children to take this leap together.

I am confident that a generation from now, we will recall fondly that we may be of different creed, race and religion but united in a common purpose through good times and bad times that shaped our children’s future and in nurturing the best sons and daughters for our community and for Singapore.
