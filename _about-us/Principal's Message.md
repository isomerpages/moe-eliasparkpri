<h4>Welcome to the website of Elias Park Primary School (EPPS)!</h4>
<p><strong>Dear Parents, Guardians and Members of the Elias Park family,</strong>
</p>
<p>It is with deep gratitude and a strong sense of purpose that I join <strong>Elias Park Primary School (EPPS)</strong> as
its new Principal. Becoming part of this vibrant community feels like being
welcomed into a family that shares common values, mutual respect and a
deep commitment to nurturing every child.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Honouring Legacy and People</strong>
</p>
<p>As I step into my role, I am mindful of the remarkable legacy built by
my predecessors — <strong>Miss Chiang Wai Leng, Miss Brenda Yeow, Mrs Wong Siew San, Mdm Cassie Fan and Mdm Chua Pei Pei</strong>.
Their stewardship has shaped EPPS into a place where pupils learn with
enthusiasm, grow with confidence and care with compassion.</p>
<p>The true Eliasian forte lies in our people — our bright, curious pupils,
our dedicated teachers, our supportive parents, and our community partners.
Together, they form the roots and branches of a thriving tree, each nourishing
the strength and vitality of the whole. It is such synergy that defines
the heart of EPPS.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Preparing for a Changing World</strong>
</p>
<p>As we look to the future, we recognise that our pupils are growing up
in a world that is changing rapidly. Advances in technology, global connectivity
and social transformation are reshaping the way we live and learn.</p>
<p>In this dynamic environment, education must go beyond academics to nurture <strong>values, curiosity, resilience and compassion</strong> —
qualities that will help our pupils navigate life’s challenges with confidence
and grace.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Our Focus Areas</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>1. Values as the Compass of Character</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Values are the compass that guide our pupils in an ever-changing world.</em>
<br>Our Eliasian values of Endeavour, Love, Integrity, Adaptability and Service
remain evergreen and at the heart of our character education. These values
come alive through everyday experiences — in classrooms, relationships
and decision-making. Our teachers will continue to model and reinforce
these values, helping pupils grow into thoughtful and principled individuals.</p>
<p><strong>2. Learning for Life and the Future</strong>
</p>
<p><em>We believe that learning should inspire curiosity and joy.</em>
<br>Our curriculum continues to provide meaningful opportunities for pupils
to explore ideas, think critically and collaborate effectively. By integrating
technology and authentic experiences, we help pupils see connections between
what they learn and the world around them. In doing so, we nurture lifelong
learners who embrace challenges with optimism and adaptability.</p>
<p><strong>3. Growth through Self-Discovery</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Every child is unique, with strengths and potential waiting to be uncovered.</em>
<br>Like gardeners tending to young plants, our teachers guide each pupil’s
growth through care, encouragement and trust. Through academics, co-curricular
activities and service, pupils discover their interests and develop confidence,
humility and gratitude as they learn to contribute meaningfully to our
community and Singapore.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead Together</strong>
</p>
<p>As I begin this new chapter with the EPPS community, I do so with humility,
excitement and hope.
<br>Together — teachers, parents, partners and pupils — we will continue to
nurture the hearts and minds of every child, keeping our school rooted
in strong values while reaching confidently towards the future.</p>
<p>With warm regards,
<br><strong>Mdm Nurazian Bajuri</strong>
<br><strong>Principal</strong>
<br><strong>Elias Park Primary School</strong>
