<p>The MOE Kindergarten Orientation Day provided a warm and meaningful welcome
to the K1 2025 children and their families at MK@Elias Park. During the
session, we introduced the MK team, including the Centre Head, teachers,
and support staff, while giving families a comprehensive overview of what
to expect when their child begins their learning journey with us in January
2025.</p>
<p>Families were guided through a typical school day, highlighting key routines,
engaging activities, and the daily schedule to help them better understand
their child's experience. For parents who have signed up for KCare services,
additional insights were shared on how KCare complements the MK program
through thoughtfully designed activities such as dedicated reading time,
outdoor play, and engaging modular activities that foster holistic development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Orientation Day not only set the stage for a smooth transition
but also strengthened the partnership between school and home, ensuring
that families feel supported as their children embark on this exciting
milestone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;We look forward to welcoming our first batch of K1 children on Thursday,
2<sup>nd</sup> January 2025 and beginning this exciting MK journey together!</p>
