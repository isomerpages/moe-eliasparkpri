<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The STEM Club engages students in Science, Technology, Engineering and
Mathematics through an integrated, hands-on approach. Through the club,
students are encouraged to explore, experiment and discover as they learn
to think creatively and critically, while developing care for others and
the environment.</p>
<p>STEM education helps prepare students for the future by connecting different
subjects into meaningful learning experiences. In the STEM Club, students
build problem-solving skills, creativity and confidence as they work on
real-world challenges.</p>
<p>Our goal is to nurture adaptive and inventive thinkers who can develop
practical solutions to everyday problems. Students learn to explore new
ideas, think flexibly and persevere when faced with challenges. We strive
to develop every student into a creator, connector and contributor who
makes a positive difference.&nbsp;</p>
