#### Description
  
Science is a study of nature in the world. Generally, students understand Science or know about the natural world based on facts. In Environmental Science, students get to learn in depth through observation and experiments. Through this, members of the Environmental Science will be able to engage in the construction of new knowledge.

Students are grouped into Lower Block (P3 and P4) and Upper Block (P5 and P6). In each block, the students will go through experiments, research and go for Learning Journeys based on the 3 different themes planned out every term throughout their 4-year journey in the CCA. The table below shows some activities that students will get to explore and learn during their CCA sessions.
