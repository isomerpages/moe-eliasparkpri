<p><strong>Description</strong>
</p>
<p>Swift Striders focuses on developing students' character, resilience,
and physical fitness. Through disciplined training and goal setting, students
learn perseverance and the importance of overcoming challenges both on
and off the track. The CCA fosters personal growth and boosts self-confidence
as students achieve individual milestones while working together as a team.
With an emphasis on improving cardiovascular health, strength, and coordination,
Swift Striders encourages a healthy, active lifestyle. By promoting discipline,
teamwork, and fitness, we aim to equip students with the skills and mindset
needed to excel in both sports and life.</p>
