Founded in 2018, Elias Park Primary School Choir aims to promote choral singing and provide a platform to showcase the choral talents of all choir members. We believe that it is of utmost importance to engage our members in meaningful experiences. Our choristers are exposed to a wide repertoire of choral pieces and performance opportunities are provided through school platforms.
