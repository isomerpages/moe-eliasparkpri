<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Founded in 2018, Elias Park Primary School Choir aims to promote choral
singing and provide a platform to showcase the choral talents of all choir
members. We believe that it is of utmost importance to engage our members
in meaningful experiences. Our choristers are exposed to a wide repertoire
of choral pieces and performance opportunities are provided through school
platforms. EPPS Choir members can look forward to singing in harmony and
mesmerizing the audience with their melodious voices. Through Choir, members
will develop performance confidence, poise and etiquette. They will also
learn the art of teamwork and cooperation.</p>
