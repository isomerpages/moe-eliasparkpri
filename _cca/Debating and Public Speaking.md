#### Description

As part of the English Language Department’s objective to develop excellence in oracy skills, ‘The Art of Public Speaking' was introduced as one of the school's main CCA to develop in students the confidence to speak in public and equip them with the finer art of public speaking. Through this CCA, students learn strategies covering three broad areas, namely constructing rich and engaging content in a speech, engaging and connecting with the audience, and understanding how one’s body language plays a critical role in the delivery of one’s speech. 

Ultimately, inhibitions are shed, self-doubts disappear and students emerge more confident and eloquent. Yearly platforms such as the Singapore World Water Day@ EPPS skit, Racial Harmony Day Outreach drama or the school’s annual year-end musical enable participants of ‘The Art of Public Speaking’ to further extend the skills learnt.
