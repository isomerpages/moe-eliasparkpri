Through this CCA, students learn strategies covering three broad areas, namely constructing rich and engaging content in a speech, engaging and connecting with the audience, and understanding how one’s body language plays a critical role in the delivery of one’s speech.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, inhibitions are shed, self-doubts disappear and students emerge more confident and eloquent. Yearly platforms such as the Singapore World Water Day@ EPPS skit, Racial Harmony Day Outreach drama or the school’s annual year-end musical enable participants of ‘The Art of Public Speaking’ to further extend the skills learnt.</p><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="299" width="480" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTOvs2Kbk65yTx703V3W9gfRiY4mJcZllIuJeszHmJ2l5OtEcb2o1hjn7c0WDvT_8XB9-IMa7wwH1MD/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000"></iframe></div><p></p>
