Self-developmental activities are a well-entrenched components of the overall drive towards encouraging “Fun &amp; Discovery” amongst the Cubs.&nbsp;The activities are based on the natural sense of fun and enthusiasm of the age group and thus the training is achieved largely through games, interaction in small groups and activities.
