### **FAQ**

1. **What is the dismissal time?**

Students are dismissed at 1.30 p.m. daily.

2. **May I park my car in the school compound if I am attending a school event?**  
Due to the limited number of parking lots, the school is not able to accommodate all visitors with vehicles. Parents attending mass briefings or events could park at one of the two multi-storey carparks at Blocks 500A or 521A just beside the school. 

3. **What are the visiting procedures?**  
All visitors to the school (including parents and guardians) are to obtain a Visitor Pass at the Security Post. Thereafter, they are to proceed to the General Office where the school staff will assist them. The pass must be prominently worn at all times.  
The operating hours of the General Office are from 7.00 a.m. to 5.30 p.m., Mondays to Fridays (during school term) and 7.00 a.m. to 4.30 p.m., Mondays to Fridays (during school holidays).  
Parents/Guardians are not allowed to walk into the classrooms to look for teachers or their child/ward, unless prior arrangements have been made (eg during Meet-The-Parents session). 

4. **What are the arrival and dismissal procedures?**  
On arrival at school, students are to proceed into the school on their own. Parents/Guardians fetching their child/ward home at dismissal, should wait for him/her outside the respective school gates (Green Gate 2, Yellow Gate 3 and Blue Gate 4). Parents/Guardians who drive their child/ward to and from school should use the designated covered drop-off/pick-up points indicated in the map shown below. This arrangement applies during rainy weather. There are sheltered connections from the drop-off/ pick-up points to the school gates.
