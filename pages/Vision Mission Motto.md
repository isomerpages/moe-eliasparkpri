The School Crest is a composition of blue on yellow. The strong blue represents civility, seriousness and respect whilst the bright yellow, warmth and cheerfulness. The superimposition of these contrasting colours indicates the desire for a balanced approach to education.

Our School Crest possesses the characteristic of duailty in design. The leaf, which signifies the sanctity of life, transforms into an image of a heart complete with twin chambers. The vessels of each work to form the letters "E" and "P"

"E" and "P" are synonymous with the ideals of "**Endeavour**" and "**Persevere**". These words, which rest on an open book, articulate that the pursuit of knowledge should ultimately lead to the cultivation of the soul. Success symbolized by the laurels, is measured by these values held within the heart. 

The bold outer ring stands for unity and cohesiveness among staff and students - our vision of the school as one happy family.
