#### (nuCLEAR@EPPS) Applied Learning Programme (ALP)  

Elias Park Primary School’s (EPPS’s) interdisciplinary Applied Learning Programme (ALP) aims to nurture citizen leaders with empathy and resilience, active in solving community issues, including taking actions as citizens of the world in upholding sustainability for the future, based on curriculum relevance and real-world experiences.

EPPS prides itself in raising the level of environmental awareness and conservation amongst her students and teachers. Being recognised with Lotus Award since 2007 and Sustained Achievement Awards since 2012, the Vanda Miss Joaquim Award in 2018, North East District Environment Award (Diamond Award) since 2017 and the recent President Award for the Environment in 2019, the school continues to impact the values of environmental conservation through various programmes and initiatives.

The ALP is also a key factor in EPPS’s invitation in MOE’s Eco Stewardship Programme, part of the Singapore Green Plan 2030 initiative announced by a multi ministerial committee in 2021 Committee of Supply in March 2021. EPPS is one of the 4 piloting schools. Through this programme, EPPS is currently collaborating with MOE Primary Science and Mathematics Curriculum Planning &amp; Development Division (CPDD), and Student Development Curriculum Division (SDCD) to co-create teaching and learning resources. As part of the school infrastructural upgrades, MOE’s Infrastructure Policy and Plans Branch (IFSD) is providing the necessary improvement works within the school to prepare for a&nbsp;**two-thirds reduction of net carbon emissions from the schools sector by 2030.**

The team is led by Team nuCLEAR, comprising of School Leaders, HOD CCE, HOD, LH and ST Science, SH Student Leadership/Discipline, Year Head (P5/P6), Admin Manager and Operations Manager. The committee monitors closely the school’s Green Programme to ensure an even greener school.
