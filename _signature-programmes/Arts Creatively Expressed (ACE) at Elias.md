<!--### Arts Creatively Expressed (ACE) @ Elias-->

Our Arts Creatively Expressed or ACE @ Elias (LLP2) programme develops the love for art and music in our students through Exposure, Experience and Appreciation. Students are trained to respond to what they see and express their ideas, feelings and experiences through various art forms and media. They will also discuss and interpret artworks for their value and impact in society.&nbsp;
