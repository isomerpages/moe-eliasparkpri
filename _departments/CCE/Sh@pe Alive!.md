 SH@PE Alive! reflects EPPS' commitment and emphasis in providing an exciting learning experience in the area of citizenship education that engages our children's senses and touches their hearts. At SH@PE Alive!, take a journey back in time to discover Singapore's humble beginnings and how our nation has grown to what it is today. Have a peek into our heritage, a feel of our traditions and way of life, and appreciate the different cultures that make up Singapore.&nbsp;

SH@PE Alive! started off with its first Learning Centre, the Dioramas @ Elias Park, which was officially opened by Superintendent of Cluster E1, Mr Jimmy Tan, on 16 May 2005. The gallery adopted 8 of the 20 dioramas previously on display at the Singapore History Museum when she closed her doors for renovation in 2003. Elias Park Primary is proud to be the only school in Singapore housing the Dioramas from the museum.

In April 2006, the school embarked on the extension of SH@PE Alive!, which houses more exhibits acquired from the SHM. The exhibits trace an important aspect of our heritage - life in the Singapore River area in the 1800s. Housed within SH@PE Alive!, is Kopitiam Elias. It is an exciting NE/SS classroom, set amidst an old 'kopitiam' setting. There are a total of 8 Learning Stations at SH@PE.

SH@PE Gallery reflects the school's commitment and emphasis in providing an exciting learning experience in the area of citizenship education that engages our children's senses and touches their hearts. We are excited about the infinite possibilities of the gallery in our school's TLLM efforts.
