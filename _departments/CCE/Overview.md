### Character &amp; Citizenship Education
 

##### Introduction  

True to the saying, “It takes a village to raise a child”, at EPPS’ CCE Department, we strongly believe in working closely with other departments and stakeholders to engage Eliasians in purposeful programmes and activities. Stakeholders can be assured that these programmes and activities have been carefully curated and are meant to steer Eliasians towards becoming responsible and respectful citizens, imbued with strong moral values.&nbsp;

  

The department’s programmes take bearing from four main foci: character development, citizenship education, pastoral care and career guidance, and student leadership.&nbsp; Each programme serves to give Eliasians opportunities at every level to enrich themselves and maximise their abilities through various experiences.

  

We warmly invite Eliasians’ family members and the community to continue to support EPPS' CCE Department to shape the morals and character of Eliasians and help them grow in their knowledge, appreciation and love for Singapore!
