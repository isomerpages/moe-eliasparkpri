##### Cyber Wellness

Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of Internet users. It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to protect oneself in cyberspace. The focus of CW is about helping students to become responsible digital learners. When navigating cyberspace, students should demonstrate respect for self and others and practise safe and responsible use. Students should also be a positive peer influence by harnessing technology for collaboration, learning and productivity, as well as advocating positive use of technology for the good of the community.  

  

As part of our holistic education for the students, the school has been actively promoting Cyber Wellness education for our students. Cyber Wellness is incorporated into the Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP), Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) and Sexuality Education lessons. In addition, special programmes and activities are also planned for the students throughout the year.

##### Cyber Wellness Newsflash

To keep our students updated on issues related to Cyber Wellness, a special programme known as the Cyber Wellness News Flash is conducted before the flag raising ceremony in the morning. Presented by the Cyber Wellness Student Ambassadors, the news flash focuses on cyber wellness related news.  
  

##### Cyber Wellness Student Ambassadors

The Cyber Wellness Student Ambassador Programme was launched in Nov 2009 to promote safe and responsible use of Information-Communication Technologies (ICT) among students through peer education. At EPPS, selected students were sent for the training. These students will help to plan and carry out cyber wellness activities besides promoting cyber wellness education for their peers.
