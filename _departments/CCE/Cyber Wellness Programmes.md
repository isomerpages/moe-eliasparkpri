<h5>Cyber Wellness</h5>
<p>Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of Internet users.
It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to
protect oneself in cyberspace. The focus of CW is about helping students
to become responsible digital learners. When navigating cyberspace, students
should demonstrate respect for self and others and practise safe and responsible
use. Students should also be a positive peer influence by harnessing technology
for collaboration, learning and productivity, as well as advocating positive
use of technology for the good of the community.</p>
<p>As part of our holistic education for the students, the school has been
actively promoting Cyber Wellness education for our students. Cyber Wellness
is incorporated into the Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP), Character
and Citizenship Education (CCE) and Sexuality Education lessons. In addition,
special programmes and activities are also planned for the students throughout
the year.</p>

<h5>Cyber Wellness Newsflash</h5>

programme known as the Cyber Wellness News Flash is conducted before the
flag raising ceremony in the morning. Presented by the Cyber Wellness Student
Ambassadors, the news flash focuses on cyber wellness related news.</p>
<h5>Cyber Wellness Student Ambassadors</h5>
<p>The Cyber Wellness Student Ambassador Programme was launched in Nov 2009
to promote safe and responsible use of Information-Communication Technologies
(ICT) among students through peer education. At EPPS, selected students
were sent for the training. These students will help to plan and carry
out cyber wellness activities besides promoting cyber wellness education
for their peers.</p>
