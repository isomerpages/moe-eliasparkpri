<h5>CCE Lessons</h5>
<p>The MOE Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) syllabus aims to inculcate
values and build social and emotional competencies in students. This in
turn is to develop them into good individuals and useful citizens in a
fast changing and globalised world. It develops students through an understanding
of the values that define the Singapore society, inspiring them to show
concern about the world they live in, and demonstrate empathy in their
relationships with others.</p>
<p>In EPPS, CCE lessons are delivered in the Mother Tongue Languages to all
our Primary 1 to 6 students.</p>
<h5>Form Teacher Guidance Period</h5>
<p>In EPPS, our Form Teachers conduct the FTGP with their respective classes
once every week. The protected weekly 60-minute period of FTGP for Primary
1 and 2 students, and 30-minute of FTGP for our Primary 3 to 6 students
allow our Form Teachers to better understand their students, build positive
relationships with them and at the same time impart to them important life
skills.</p>
<h5>Sexuality Education</h5>
<p>In EPPS, our specially selected, MOE-trained Sexuality Education (SEd)
teachers conduct the SEd programme for our Primary 5 and 6 students. Through
the SEd programme, we aim to enable our students to understand the physical,
social and emotional changes they will experience as they mature, develop
healthy and rewarding relationships and make wise, informed and responsible
decisions on sexuality matters in their growing up years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h5>Elias Peaks Student Recognition Framework</h5>
<p>In EPPS, student recognition is&nbsp;<strong>holistic and inclusive</strong>,&nbsp;with
emphasis on reinforcement of desired behaviours through regular affirmation.&nbsp;The
'Elias Peaks' is a platform that recognizes all Eliasians who demonstrate
behaviour as depicted in the&nbsp;<strong>school’s Core Values</strong>&nbsp;of
Endeavour, Love, Integrity, Adaptability and Service (ELIAS).&nbsp;The
Elias Peaks provides affirmation to students&nbsp;<strong>at both individual and class levels</strong>,
with the monthly Best Student Awards with nominations from peers forming
the first level. Awards are given at each month, term, semester and annual
time frames, with those given at Honours Day, and MOE Edusave Awards such
as ECHA and EAGLES forming the highest award levels.&nbsp;This continual
effort aims to nurture their character growth and help to socialize them
into morally upright individuals.</p>

<h3>Character in Action@EPPS&nbsp;</h3>
<p>EPPS promotes a&nbsp;<strong>whole-child model</strong>&nbsp;for character
development in her students. All three domains of moral knowing, feeling
and action of a child are engaged in the planning for effective character
and citizenship development of Eliasians.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Complementing and supporting the curricula of the MOE Character and Citizenship
Education (CCE), the guidance modules (i.e. Cyber Wellness, Sexuality Education
and Education and Career Guidance) and the Form Teacher Guidance Period
(FTGP) which allow teachers to focus more on teaching moral knowing and
feeling based on the fundamental progressive needs of students, EPPS has
the&nbsp;<em>Character In Action @ EPPS</em>. This programme&nbsp;<strong>anchors on National Education (NE)</strong>,
a niche area of the school, to broaden Eliasians’ perspectives through
events linked to the NE messages, and evoke and/or deepen their thoughts
and feelings on issues pertaining to the MOE CCE core values of Respect,
Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care and Harmony (R3ICH) to which
the school’s core values (Excellence, Love, Integrity, Adaptability, Service)
are aligned. In doing so,&nbsp;<em>Character In Action @ EPPS</em>&nbsp;aims
to:</p>
<p>• develop the Eliasian Citizen who&nbsp;</p>
<p>- has self and social awareness and management
<br>- is informed about local and world affairs
<br>- knows and loves Singapore
<br>- takes an active role to improve the lives of others around him&nbsp;</p>
<p>• develop the Eliasian Leader who</p>
<p>- has the moral courage to stand up for what is right
<br>- exercises initiatives and takes calculated risks
<br>- is able to cooperate, share and care for others
<br>- takes personal responsibility for his actions and decisions</p>
<p>These are part of the Desired Outcomes of an Eliasian.</p>
<p>Riding on the subject vehicle of NE to surface retrospective events which
bond the nation,&nbsp;<em>Character In Action @ EPPS</em>&nbsp;works on
impacting the hearts of Eliasians through authentic experiential learning
and providing the ethical motivation, competencies and opportunities for
their moral action or character performance. Specifically,&nbsp;<em>Character In Action @ EPPS</em>&nbsp;facilitates
students’ acquisition and/or reinforcement of key competencies within the
social and emotional (SE) domains of Self Awareness, Self-Management, Social
Awareness, Relationship Management and Responsible Decision Making. It
also caters for the development of the citizenship competencies under the
domain of Civic Literacy, Global Awareness &amp; Cross Cultural Skills
(CGC) within the 21st Century Competencies (21CC) framework.</p>
<p>Implementation of the&nbsp;<em>Character In Action @ EPPS</em>&nbsp;is
tiered at 2 levels to optimally cater to students’ needs, interests and
potential.</p>
<h4>Level 1: Broad-Based Development (School-wide)</h4>
<p>At Level 1, the Character In Action @ EPPS reaches out to every single
Eliasian through two key components of experiential learning, namely the
Singapore Heritage @ Elias Park (SH@PE) Alive! experience and the Every
Eliasian a Leader (EEL).</p>
<h5>SH@PE Alive! Experience</h5>
<p>The SH@PE Alive! learning trail aims to stimulate thinking, evoke feelings
and provide hands-on practices, so as to engage the head, heart and hands
of every individual going on the SH@PE Alive trail. At SH@PE Alive!, students
will discover Singapore's humble beginnings and how our nation has grown
to what it is today. They will be able to gain insights to our rich heritage,
have a feel of our customs and traditions, be connected to the way of life
of yesteryears, and appreciate the different cultures that make up Singapore.
This is where the various NE messages come alive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Activities at SH@PE Alive!</h5>

</div>
<h5>Every Eliasian a Leader (EEL)</h5>
<p>Working alongside the SH@PE Alive! experience to support the holistic
development of Eliasians’ character is the EEL. EEL offers Eliasians different
leadership positions to bring out the leader in every child - one with
the right values, mindsets and skills to excel in the field he/she chooses
to pursue as a future leader of Singapore. With the vast opportunities
offered by EEL, every Eliasian can be a leader. The Student Leaders in
EPPS include two groups, first being the Core Leaders (e.g. Prefects and
Main CCA Leaders) and, second being the Situational Leaders (e.g. Class/
NE/ Go-Green Monitors).</p>
<h4>Level 2: Extension and Student Leadership (Scoped Target Group)</h4>
<p>At Level 2, the&nbsp;<em>Character In Action @ EPPS</em>&nbsp;extends
its reach to Eliasians who have been assessed and identified by teachers
to have the added passion in NE and the leadership competencies and/or
potential to educate, impact and influence their peers and others in the
community on the values of R3ICH and how to live out these values as a
nation. These Eliasians who are called&nbsp;<strong>SH@PE Guides</strong>&nbsp;form
a special group of student leaders in EPPS.</p>
