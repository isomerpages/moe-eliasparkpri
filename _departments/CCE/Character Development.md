### Character Development NOT DONE YET
 

##### CCE Lessons

The MOE Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) syllabus aims to inculcate values and build social and emotional competencies in students. This in turn is to develop them into good individuals and useful citizens in a fast changing and globalised world. It develops students through an understanding of the values that define the Singapore society, inspiring them to show concern about the world they live in, and demonstrate empathy in their relationships with others.

In EPPS, CCE lessons are delivered in the Mother Tongue Languages to all our Primary 1 to 6 students.

##### Form Teacher Guidance Period

In EPPS, our Form Teachers conduct the FTGP with their respective classes once every week. The protected weekly 60-minute period of FTGP for Primary 1 and 2 students, and 30-minute of FTGP for our Primary 3 to 6 students allow our Form Teachers to better understand their students, build positive relationships with them and at the same time impart to them important life skills.  
  

##### Sexuality Education

In EPPS, our specially selected, MOE-trained Sexuality Education (SEd) teachers conduct the SEd programme for our Primary 5 and 6 students. Through the SEd programme, we aim to enable our students to understand the physical, social and emotional changes they will experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters in their growing up years.

##### Elias Peaks Student Recognition Framework

In EPPS, student recognition is **holistic and inclusive**, with emphasis on reinforcement of desired behaviours through regular affirmation. The 'Elias Peaks' is a platform that recognizes all Eliasians who demonstrate behaviour as depicted in the **school’s Core Values** of Endeavour, Love, Integrity, Adaptability and Service (ELIAS). The Elias Peaks provides affirmation to students **at both individual and class levels**, with the monthly Best Student Awards with nominations from peers forming the first level. Awards are given at each month, term, semester and annual time frames, with those given at Honours Day, and MOE Edusave Awards such as ECHA and EAGLES forming the highest award levels. This continual effort aims to nurture their character growth and help to socialize them into morally upright individuals.
