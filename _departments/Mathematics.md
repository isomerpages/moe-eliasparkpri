<h5>Vision</h5>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Critical and creative thinkers who are independent and innovative problem-solvers
in an ever-changing world.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Mission</h5>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We seek to prepare our students for life by providing them with the essential
mathematical knowledge and developing their thinking skills.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Learning Outcomes</h5>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students who can adapt and apply their problem-solving skills in daily
life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SStudents who possess both critical and creative thinking.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Approach/Framework</h5>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Curriculum
<br>Elias Park Primary School adopts the 2021 Mathematics syllabus (P1-P6)
which reflects the recent development and trends in mathematics education.
We emphasize conceptual understanding, skill proficiency and mathematical
processes, reasoning and communications which are integral to the development
of mathematical problem-solving ability to think logically, abstractly,
critically and creatively. Below is the MOE’s Mathematics Framework.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The central focus of MOE’s Mathematics Framework is mathematical problem
solving. This sets the direction for and provides guidance for the Mathematics
Department in the teaching and learning and the assessment of mathematics.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;Goals/Objectives
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - To achieve performance in PSLE by maintaining above
National
<br>Average result and improving the quality and quantity passes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - To nurture Eliasians to be creative thinkers, self-directed,
<br>independent learners and innovative problem solvers by
<br>enriching them with mathematics content, knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;Focus
<br>- Visible Learning
<br>- Experiential Learning through activity-based lessons
<br>- Formative Assessments</p>
<p>Every Eliasian should experience these 3 phases of learning:</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:60%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/math2.png">
</div>
<p>Interweaved into the 3 phases of learning is the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract
approach, the key pedagogy that teachers are using:&nbsp;The concrete-pictorial-abstract
approach consists of 3 stages necessary for students to develop understanding&nbsp;of
a concept. Reinforcement is achieved by going back and forth between these
representations.</p>
<p><em>Concrete representation</em>&nbsp;- a student is first introduced
to an idea or a skill by acting it out with real objects or manipulatives
to develop the foundation for conceptual understanding.</p>
<p><em>Pictorial representation</em>&nbsp;- a student has sufficiently understood
the hands-on experiences performed and can now relate them to representations,
such as a diagram or picture of the problem</p>
<p><em>Abstract representation</em>&nbsp;- a student is now capable of representing
problems by using mathematical notation.&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Programmes</h5>
<p>•&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) Programme</strong>
<br>LSM programme is conducted by trained teachers that aims to provide support
for low progress learners, focussing on developing numeracy skills for
P1 to P4 students.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>F.A.S.T Progamme (Primary 1 to 3)</strong>
<br>F.A.S.T (Fluency, Accuracy, Speed in a given Time) is a programme that
aims to improve students’ proficiency in performing calculations involving
the 4 operations. The mastery in this area would help to reduce their cognitive
load so as to allow students to focus on problem-solving matters.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Mathematical Olympiad Competitions (Primary 5 and 6)</strong>
<br>Eliasians who possess great aptitude for Mathematics are identified for
this programme. Through the training, they will acquire skills and techniques
required to solve challenging problems and be exposed to the spirit of
learning through discovery. They will gain a sense of accomplishment through
participating in Mathematical Olympiad competitions such as the Singapore
Mathematical Olympiad for Primary Schools (SMOPS) for Primary 6 and National
Mathematical Olympiad of Singapore (NMOS) for Primary 5.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Fantastic Friday</strong>
<br>Eliasians end the week by recalling the concepts taught in the week. This
is done via an online Mathematics learning portal which also acts as an
additional learning resource for your child. Mathematics teachers will
dispatch assignments every Friday based on the integrated approach of interleaved
and blocked practice so as to ensure the students’ proficiency level in
the concepts do not decay over time.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Mathematics Thinking Log (Primary 1 to 5)</strong>
<br>Thinking log serves as a platform for students to document what they have
learnt throughout the lesson. It allows students to take responsible of
their own learning, thus nurturing them to be self-directed learners.</p>
<p>In alignment with our department vision and mission, we have put in place
a variety of programmes to bring this vision and mission to fruition.</p>
