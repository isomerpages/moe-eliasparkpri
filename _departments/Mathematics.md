### Mathematics

##### Vision  

Critical and creative thinkers who are independent and innovative problem-solvers in an ever-changing world.  
  

##### Mission

We seek to prepare our students for life by providing them with the essential Mathematical knowledge and developing their thinking skills.  
  

##### Learning Outcomes

*   Students who are able to adapt and apply their problem-solving skills in daily life.
*   Students who possess both critical and creative thinking

  

##### Approach/Framework

*   Curriculum  
Elias Park Primary School adopts the 2013 Mathematics syllabus (P4-P6) and the 2021 Mathematics syllabus (P1-P3) which reflects the recent development and trends in mathematics education. We emphasize on conceptual understanding, skill proficiencies and mathematical processes, reasoning and communications which are integral to the development of mathematical problem-solving ability to think logically, abstractly, critically and creatively. Below is the MOE’s Mathematics Framework.

The central focus of MOE’s Mathematics Framework is mathematical problem solving. This sets the direction for and provides guidance for the Mathematics Department in the teaching and learning, and the assessment of mathematics.

*   Goals/Objectives  
    • To achieve performance in PSLE by maintaining above National Average result and improving the quality and  
    &nbsp; quantity passes.  
    • To nurture Eliasians to be creative thinkers, self-directed, independent learners and innovative problem  
    &nbsp; solvers by enriching them with Mathematics content and knowledge skills.  

*   Focus  
    •&nbsp;Visible Learning&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
    • Multi-disciplinary projects for Primary 3 to Primary 6 levels  
    • Experiential Learning through activity-based lessons  
    • Formative Assessments  
    

Every Eliasian should experience these 3 phases of learning:

Interweaved into the 3 phases of learning is the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract approach, the key pedagogy that teachers are using:&nbsp;The concrete-pictorial-abstract approach consists of 3 stages necessary for students to develop understanding&nbsp;of a concept. Reinforcement is achieved by going back and forth between these representations.

_Concrete representation_&nbsp;\- a student is first introduced to an idea or a skill by acting it out with real objects or manipulatives to develop the foundation for conceptual understanding.

_Pictorial representation_&nbsp;\- a student has sufficiently understood the hands-on experiences performed and can now relate them to representations, such as a diagram or picture of the problem

_Abstract representation_&nbsp;\- a student is now capable of representing problems by using mathematical notation.&nbsp;  
  

##### Programmes  

*   **Mathematics Journal (Primary 1 to&nbsp; 6)**&nbsp;
<br>Mathematics Journals are platforms for students to communicate the reasons behind their thinking based on selected given concepts. This would allow their thinking to be made more visible through the appropriate use of mathematical language.

*   **F.A.S.T Progamme (Primary**&nbsp;**1 to 3)**&nbsp;  
    F.A.S.T (Fluency, Accuracy, Speed in a given Time) is a programme that aims to improve students’ proficiency in performing calculations involving the 4 operations. The mastery in this area would help to reduce their cognitive load so as to allow students to focus on problem-solving matters.

*   **Mathematical Olympiad Competitions (Primary 5 and 6)**
<br>Eliasians who possess great aptitude for Mathematics are identified for this programme. Through the  training, they will acquire skills and techniques required to solve challenging problems and be exposed to the spirit of learning through discovery. They will gain a sense of accomplishment through participating in Mathematical Olympiad competitions such as the Singapore Mathematical Olympiad for Primary Schools (SMOPS) for Primary 6 and National Mathematical Olympiad of Singapore (NMOS) for Primary 5.

*   **Improve Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN)**  
    ICAN is targeted at improving the confidence and achievement of low progress learners in Mathematics by levelling up the students in the learning of Mathematics using intervention strategies to tackle 4 key issues of learning gaps, language, motivation and memory.



*   **Mathastic Monday**&nbsp;&nbsp;  
    Eliasians start the week by recalling the concepts taught in the previous week. This is done via an online Math learning portal which also acts as an additional learning resource for students. Math teachers will dispatch assignments every Monday based on the integrated approach of interleaved and blocked practice so as to ensure the students’ proficiency level in the concepts do not decay over time.&nbsp;
*   **Mathematics Learning Log (Primary 3 to 6)**  
    Learning log serves as a platform for students to document what they have learnt throughout the lesson. It allows students to take responsible of their own learning, thus nurturing them to be self-directed learners.&nbsp;
		
In alignment with our department vision and mission, we have put in place a variety of programmes to bring this vision and mission to fruition.
