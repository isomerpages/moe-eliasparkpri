*   Plays a key role in the holistic development of our students as it focuses on development of specific knowledge, skills and values based on the student’s choice of CCA
*   Offers 11&nbsp;different CCAs ranging from Sports, Aesthetics, Clubs to a Uniformed&nbsp;Group

  

##### CCA REGISTRATION

*   All&nbsp;Primary 3 to 6 students&nbsp;are strongly encouraged to&nbsp;take part in&nbsp;1 CCA
*   CCA roadshow will be conducted annually in Term 4 for all Primary 2 students and Primary 3 and 4 students who are not in any CCA
*   Students will indicate up to 4 preferred choices of CCA after the CCA roadshow
*   To ensure full commitment,&nbsp;each student&nbsp;will only be allocated 1&nbsp;CCA

  

##### CCA ALLOCATION

  

The school will allocate each student with&nbsp;1&nbsp;CCA based on:  
1\. CCA availability  <br>
2\. Students’ preference  <br>
