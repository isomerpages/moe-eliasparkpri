### Aesthetics

##### Vision  

Growing the artist in every Eliasian.

  

##### Mission

Nurturing the Eliasian Artist by providing opportunities for&nbsp;exposure, experience and appreciation in arts.  

  

#### Learning Outcomes

##### Music

**Aims of the General Music Programme are:**

*   Develop awareness and appreciation of music in local and global cultures&nbsp;
*   Develop ability for creative expression and communication through music
*   Provide the basis to develop an informed and life-long involvement in music

Music, being an integral part of many cultures, provides a means to raise local and global awareness amongst our students and enables them to appreciate and express their thoughts and ideas creatively. The processes involved in music performing and creating develop skills such as listening skills, fine motor skills, creative thinking skills and social skills.&nbsp;

#### Art

**Aims of the Arts Education Programme are to enable every child to:**

*   Enjoy&nbsp;and appreciate Art
*   Communicate&nbsp;visually
*   Make meaning through connecting with society and culture.

Guided by these 3 aims, our art curriculum provides our students with a balanced and well-rounded education in the aesthetic, cognitive and affective dimensions. It presents ample opportunities for creative and innovative self-expression in varied modes. The learning of local artworks and artists strengthens the understanding of the individual’s national identity by fostering the appreciation of one’s cultural heritage. The engagement in art discussions in the curriculum promotes a lifelong enjoyment and an appreciation for artistic works; developing visual literacy in our students.&nbsp;

#### Approach/ Framework

To develop our Eliasians' interest and talent in the Arts and Music, we have 3 tiers framework to create diverse learning experiences in Art, Music, Drama and Dance. Our holistic approach also gives Eliasians the opportunities to express themselves and deepen their sense of pride in our multi-cultural heritage.

#### Programmes
