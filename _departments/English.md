<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

<p>Confident communicators who love the English language</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Mission</h5>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To provide English Language learning experiences that allow students to
communicate confidently and respectfully and grow their love for the language</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Learning Outcomes</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Students who have a strong foundation in the English Language</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students who can communicate clearly, confidently and graciously</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Approach/Framework</h5>
<p>At the heart of our programme is the Strategies for English Language Learning
and Reading (STELLAR) approach, which caters to the diverse needs of learners
by building confidence in oral communication and strengthening literacy
development. Through purposeful, enjoyable and authentic language learning
experiences, students are provided with meaningful opportunities to explore
ideas, think critically and collaborate effectively. They learn to speak
and write confidently for different purposes, audiences and contexts, while
making thoughtful connections between classroom texts, their prior knowledge
and their lived experiences.</p>
<p>Aligned with the English Language Syllabus 2020, our teaching approach
emphasises multiliteracies, metacognition and inquiry through dialogue.
Where appropriate, technology and real-world contexts are integrated to
enrich learning and help students see the relevance of what they learn
beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>Through learning experiences in the English Language classroom, we aim
to nurture our students to be:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Empathetic Communicators</strong> who possess the values, dispositions
and skills to listen actively and engage respectfully with diverse perspectives;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Discerning Readers</strong> who are informed, reflective and self-directed
in their use of information; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Creative Inquirers</strong> who question with curiosity, explore
ideas deeply and evaluate real-world issues from multiple perspectives.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h5>Programmes</h5>
<p>In alignment with our department vision and mission, the school has put
in place a variety of programmes to bring this vision and mission to fruition:</p>
<p><strong>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oral Communication Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The English Department nurtures confident and competent communicators
through daily lessons and structured class discussions. Specially designed <em>Talk Cards</em> support
the Inquiry through Dialogue approach by scaffolding purposeful classroom
talk – guiding students to ask questions, build on ideas, clarify thinking,
and express views clearly and respectfully. Through regular use in pair,
group, and class discussions, students build confidence in oral presentation
while strengthening their communication and collaboration skills through
active listening and meaningful interaction.</p>
<p><strong>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; School Reading Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The school cultivates in students a love for reading by building a pervasive
reading culture in the school through library activities.</p>
<p><strong>Bookflix Binge Fest</strong>
</p>
<p>Bookflix Binge Fest is a termly activity designed to encourage students
to broaden their reading diet by exploring titles from targeted genres.
The initiative introduces them to books they may not usually choose, prompting
them to give such titles a try and discover new perspectives. A curated
selection of works is shared with students, accompanied by engaging fun
facts about the stories or authors to spark curiosity. To deepen the experience,
students submit short summaries or reflections on what they enjoy about
the books. These peer‑generated insights help to influence others, inspiring
more students to pick up the recommended titles and develop a more varied
and enriching reading journey.</p>
<p><strong>Eco‑Tales Writers’ Circle</strong>
</p>
<p>Eco‑Tales Writers’ Circle encourages students to engage with a wide range
of texts for enjoyment while developing an understanding of how semiotic
modes are used in diverse contexts. The initiative provides opportunities
for students to apply their critical thinking and reasoning skills by stepping
into the role of author, making creative edits to curated titles. For example,
they may suggest alternative endings through writing or illustration, thereby
exercising both analytical and imaginative abilities. The activity is closely
aligned with the school’s commitment to sustainable education, offering
students the joy of learning in an authentic and meaningful setting.</p>
<p><strong>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Current Affairs Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The school adopts <em>Little Red Dot</em> as a supplementary reading resource
for all Primary 3 and 4 classes and <em>What’s Up</em> as a supplementary
reading resource for all Primary 5 and 6 classes. Through the use of these
resources, the school aims to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>cultivate students’ awareness of local and global issues by enabling them
to synthesise information, make meaningful connections, and develop well-reasoned
perspectives; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop students into concerned and empathetic citizens who listen attentively
to, and demonstrate respect for, diverse viewpoints on local and global
issues.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Literature Appreciation</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Primary 5 Literature Appreciation programme centers on the novel The
Mudskipper, aiming to foster a genuine love for reading and an appreciation
for English Literature. Students engage in deep text analysis through character
studies, perspective-taking exercises, and role-play activities. These
lessons are designed to sharpen critical reading and thinking skills as
students compare character motivations and plot developments. Beyond literacy,
the programme encourages Eliasians to reflect on the core values and leadership
attributes portrayed in the story, helping them connect the themes of the
book to their own personal growth.</p>
<p><strong>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Integrated and Authentic Learning Experiences</strong>
</p>
<p>We believe that language learning should extend beyond the classroom through
integrated and authentic experiences that bring STELLAR texts to life.
Aligned with the themes of each unit of study, these experiences enable
students to engage meaningfully with the cultural and real-world contexts
of the texts. Each activity is purposefully selected to complement classroom
learning.</p>
<p><strong>f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; English Language Enhanced Appreciation Programme (ELEAP)</strong>
</p>
<p>The <strong>ELEAP </strong>is designed to cater to our learners' diverse
abilities and interests. By providing varied platforms for expression,
the programme allows students with a strong aptitude for English to deepen
their communication skills and explore the language through creative and
authentic applications.</p>
<p>The programme focuses on honing oral communication and critical thinking
through three main activities:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
