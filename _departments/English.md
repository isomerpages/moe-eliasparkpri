<h5>Approach/Framework</h5>
<p>At the heart of our programme is the Strategies for English Language Learning
and Reading (STELLAR) approach, which caters to the diverse needs of learners
by building confidence in oral communication and strengthening literacy
development. Through purposeful, enjoyable and authentic language learning
experiences, students are provided with meaningful opportunities to explore
ideas, think critically and collaborate effectively. They learn to speak
and write confidently for different purposes, audiences and contexts, while
making thoughtful connections between classroom texts, their prior knowledge
and their lived experiences.</p>
<p>Aligned with the English Language Syllabus 2020, our teaching approach
emphasises multiliteracies, metacognition and inquiry through dialogue.
Where appropriate, technology and real-world contexts are integrated to
enrich learning and help students see the relevance of what they learn
beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>Through learning experiences in the English Language classroom, we aim
to nurture our students to be:</p>
