<p><strong>SOAR Programme (P1 and P2)</strong>
<br>At our school, we recognise the immense benefits of reading, including
fostering stronger intrinsic motivation, enhancing socio-emotional skills,
and achieving better academic outcomes and global competence. In line with
the Mother Tongue Language Branch (MTLB)'s vision, we strive to ignite
our students' passion for reading in their Mother Tongue Languages. Through
initiatives such as <em>Spark Interest, Open Minds, Appreciate Cultural Roots,</em> and <em>Rise as Bilingual Readers,</em> we
provide structured support and resources to complement existing school-wide
reading programmes. By nurturing positive reading habits and dispositions
from a young age, we aim to inspire our students to embrace the joy of
reading while appreciating their cultural heritage and developing as confident
bilingual individuals.</p>

<p><strong>MLLPC Cultural Performance Exposure Fund 2024</strong>
<br>The Cultural Performance Exposure Fund (CPEF) is a programme by the Malay
Language Learning and Promotion Committee designed to complement the teaching
and learning of the Malay Language by providing enriching experiences beyond
the classroom. Through this initiative, our Primary 4 students had the
opportunity to enjoy and immerse themselves in a rich and engaging Malay
cultural performance. This experience not only deepened their appreciation
for the Malay Language but also sparked their interest in its cultural
roots, enriching their overall learning journey.</p>
