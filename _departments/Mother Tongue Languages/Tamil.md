This programme is for students in Primary 3 and Primary 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;MTSP caters to students who need additional support in the learning of Mother Tongue.

*   Cultural Activities  
The P5 Tamil students had the Villupaatu Workshop, an ancient form of musical story-telling on 31st March and 1st April in conjunction with the Mother-Tongue Language Fortnight. During the workshop, students learnt about the origin of Villupaatu, the occasions this style of storytelling was used, how a villupattu is performed and how it is different from traditional storytelling methods. Thereafter, the students worked in groups to perform a villupaatu to their classmates confidently. This workshop helped the students improve their spoken, listening and reading skills.
