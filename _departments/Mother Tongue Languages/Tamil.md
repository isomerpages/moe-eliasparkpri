<br>The P5 Tamil students had the Villupaatu Workshop, an ancient form of
musical story-telling on 31st March and 1st April in conjunction with the
Mother-Tongue Language Fortnight. During the workshop, students learnt

was used, how a villupattu is performed and how it is different from traditional
storytelling methods. Thereafter, the students worked in groups to perform
a villupaatu to their classmates confidently. This workshop helped the
