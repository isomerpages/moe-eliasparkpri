##### Healthy Plate & Healthy Snacks 

Eliasians are encouraged to make an effort to live a healthy life through daily healthy meals and healthy snacks. Eating a healthy plate and having healthy snacks is a good habit that we as teachers and parents need to instil in our children. At EPPS, students have a snack time from 11.50 pm – 12.00 pm where they are encouraged to eat healthy snacks. Recommended snacks include fruits, vegetables, nuts & raisins, wholemeal bread, wholemeal biscuits, cereals, plain water etc. During recess, teachers on duty will award PBS stamps to students who eat their fruits and vegetables. PBS stamps can be used to redeem prizes.
