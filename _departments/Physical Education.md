<h5>Healthy Plate &amp; Healthy Snacks&nbsp;</h5>
<p>Eliasians are encouraged to make an effort to live a healthy life through
daily healthy meals and healthy snacks. Eating a healthy plate and having
healthy snacks is a good habit that we as teachers and parents need to
instill in our children. At EPPS, students have snack time every day, and
they are encouraged to eat healthy snacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recommended snacks include fruits, vegetables, nuts, raisins, wholemeal
bread, wholemeal biscuits and cereals. Students are also strongly encouraged
to have their water bottles with them and make water their first choice
of beverage.</p>
